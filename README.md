- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @australeo
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in vulnerability research, primarily on Windows, yet somehow still spend an inordinate amount of time reading Linux kernel code.
- âœ¨ I often think about creating static analysis tools, but always end up writing more fuzzers.
- ğŸ¦€ I'm one of those people who won't shut up about Rust...
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: <a rel="me" href="https://infosec.exchange/@australeo">Mastodon</a>.
