- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @australeo
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in vulnerability research, primarily on Windows, yet somehow still spend an inordinate amount of time reading Linux kernel code.
- âœ¨ I often think about creating static analysis tools, but always end up writing more fuzzers.
- ğŸ¦€ I just think Rust is nice.
